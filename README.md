# WORDLE

*Available in three languages: Spanish (**ES**), Catalan (**CA**), and English (**EN**).*

Just like the original game, you have **6 attempts** to guess the random word, which is updated daily at **00:00** 🕛  
🟩 → correct letter in the correct position  
🟧 → correct letter in the wrong position  
⬜️ → incorrect letter  

✔ It won’t let you enter words that aren’t in the dictionary.  
✔ It will warn you if you try to use a letter that has already been ruled out.

The game is built with **Python**, using the **Tkinter** library for the UI and **SQLite** for the database.
