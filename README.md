# WORDLE

*Available in three languages: Spanish (**ES**), Catalan (**CA**), and English (**EN**).*

Just like the original game, you have **6 attempts** to guess the random word, which is updated daily at **00:00** 🕛  
🟩 → correct letter in the correct position  
🟧 → correct letter in the wrong position  
⬜️ → incorrect letter  

It won’t allow you to enter words that aren’t in the dictionary.
It will let you know if you attempt to use a letter that has already been ruled out.

It's built with **Python**, using the **TKinter** library for UI and **SQLite** for DB.
