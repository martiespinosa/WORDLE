# Wordle

This is in three idioms: Spanish (ES), Catalan (CA), and English (EN).

Just like the original game, you have 6 attempts to guess the word and it gets updated every day at 00:00 🕛

It will let you know if yu are writting some letter that you already know it's not in the word and it doesn't let you write words that doesn't exist in the dictionary 🥸

It's written in Python and I used TKinter library for the UI and SQLite for database.
